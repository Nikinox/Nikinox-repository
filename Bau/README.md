Features

You insert your name, and then you chat with this "Dog".
He always says "bau" or "BAU" but for some words like "cat" or "food" he will answer also with some other ouput


The process

It all started as a scrypt that only respons bau  for like 999 times, then i started to insert the ability to react to the word "cat", and finally the project became what it became.


What I learned

I learned to manage inputs


What could be improved

There could be some more words he reacts to
There could be a small language model to give it an actual brain
