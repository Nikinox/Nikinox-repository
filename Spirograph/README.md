Intro
This is a script that when runned shows a drawing that at the end shows multiple sqauares of different colors.
It's just a funny way to experiment with the library turtle.

Technologies
Python: tkinter
        turtle

Features
You run it and watch the draw appearing.

The process
I just wanted to create a simple script to make some practice with the turtle library and replicate a drawing, I searched on YouTube for a tutorial and I followed it.

What I learned
I learned about those libraries and I understood a little bit better how to use them.

What could be improved
In the future, there could be the possibility to choose the shape and do the same thing.
There could also be the possibility to use two shapes in the same drawing to get an even cooler effect, like a circle inside of a square and do it.
There could also be the possibility to draw a shape using another one, for example using multiple squares to draw a circle.
