Intro

This is a white noise generator.

Technologies

Python:numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.io.wavfile, scipy.signal, sounddevice

Features

You insert the duration you want the audio to have and in a few seconds he will generaate the audio.
When he plays the audio, before it a message pops up and says to pay atttention to the sound because it might be too loud and to put a lower volume to the device.

The process

I build it so I could always listen to some white noise when i needed it without needing connection and always going to search it online.

What I learned

I learned to manage the sound with python which I never tried before.

What could be improved

I will try as soon as possible to create a GUI so the program is more user-friendly.
