Intro
This is a script that shifts the letters of a string.
It can switch every letter to the next one and do the opposite, maybe someone sent you a message with strange letters and you want to try to "translate" it into a more readable text.

Technologies
Python:string

Features
It shifts the text with the "key" real:shifted=a:b
It can also "reverse shift" the text with the "key" shifted:reak=b:a

The process
I started by building the "encryption" system, I searched on the internet how to do that.
Then, I thought it would have been useful also writing the script that does the opposite in another file, I searched also there how to do that.
Finally, I merged the scripts in one file and added the possibility to do this process choosing at the beginning which one to do and doing it until you say you want to stop.

What I learned
I learned how to manipulate strings and change the letters with a certain "key".

What could be improved
An improvement would be creating a GUI so the tool seems more user-friendly.
