I'm Nikinox.

I'm a teenager who loves programming and building things.  
I'm currently focused on creating as many projects as I can to learn, improve, and gradually move toward bigger and more complex systems.

I mainly work with Python 3.8, and I often prototype small ideas in lightweight online environments before turning them into proper projects.  
I use Notepad++ as my main code editor, and Google Colab when experimenting with small machine learning programs.

My goal is simple: keep building, keep learning, and keep improving.
