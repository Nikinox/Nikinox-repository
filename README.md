I'm Nikinox. 

I'm a teenager and I like very much programming. 

I'm working on building as many things as possible to learn as much as possible, hoping in the future the projects will get bigger and more complex.

I use Python 3.8 to run and create python programs, I use codeskulptor for quick tests in python before I save them, I use mycompiler to run and create programs in the other languages for now and i use notepad++ as my code editor and Google Colab whenever I test some little ML programs.
